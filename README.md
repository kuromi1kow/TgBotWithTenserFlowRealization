# Singer Recommendation Bot

## Overview
This project is an implementation of a Telegram bot that provides singer recommendations. It utilizes various technologies and libraries such as pandas, Flask, NumPy, TensorFlow, and the Telegram Bot API to create an interactive and engaging experience.

## Features
- Echoes back the artist name sent by the user.
- (If implemented) Connects to a Flask server to process artist names and provide song or artist recommendations.
- Uses pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Leverages TensorFlow for any machine learning or neural network-based recommendation logic.
- Simple and interactive Telegram bot interface.

## How it Works
The bot receives an artist name from the user and processes it. The core logic for generating recommendations (if implemented) would be handled by a Flask server, which can use machine learning models built with TensorFlow to analyze and predict similar artists or songs.

## Setup and Installation
(Provide detailed steps on setting up and running your project, including installing dependencies, setting up the Flask server, and running the Telegram bot.)

## Usage
Just write in our tg bot or you can just write in google collab.
## Technologies Used
